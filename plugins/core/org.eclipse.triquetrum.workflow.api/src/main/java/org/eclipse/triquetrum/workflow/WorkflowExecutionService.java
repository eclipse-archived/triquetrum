  /**
   * Start a workflow process in the specified mode.
   * <p>
   * This method should run the model in a non-blocking way, i.e. should return swiftly with the created <code>ProcessHandle</code> while the process may keep
   * on running in the background for a longer period of time.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * The optional listener will be notified of all detailed <code>ProcessEvent</code>s. Remark that in the absence of a listener, steps/resume may still be
   * triggered via <code>step()</code> and <code>resume()</code>, and status info may be obtained via iteratively invoking <code>refresh(Processhandle)</code>.
   * <br/>
   * But such a "polling" approach is not desirable. A listener-based approach is almost always more efficient and more powerful.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * In <b>RUN</b> mode, the execution will typically run in one shot until the end.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * Via a <code>suspend()</code> request, the execution can be suspended. After which it can be continued again via <code>resume()</code>, or per
   * <code>step()</code> etc.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * In <b>STEP</b> mode, Task executions are done one-by-one, each time a <code>step()</code> has been requested. Via <code>resume()</code>, the execution can
   * continue as in <b>NORMAL</b> mode.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * In <b>DEBUG</b> mode, the execution may (partially) suspend on one or more of the specified break points. After which it can be continued again via one of
   * the <code>resume()</code> methods, or per <code>step()</code> etc.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * Upon reaching a breakpoint, the model execution is completely suspended, similarly as via an explicit suspend() call.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * Breakpoints must refer to named elements in the running process : actors and/or ports. <br/>
   * The names given should be the full hierarchic names, without the flow's name. E.g. in a HelloWorld model with a Constant actor connected to a Console,
   * valid breakpoints could be :
   * <ul>
   * <li>Constant</li>
   * <li>Console.input</li>
   * <li>etc.</li>
   * </ul>
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * The optional <code>processId</code> identifies a Process that is being executed across one or more workflow executions. Such <code>Process</code> instances
   * are typically created outside of the Passerelle runtime services. For simple processes, each workflow execution typically corresponds to one Process which
   * ends up in a final status. For more complex processes, several consecutive workflow executions may be involved that are linked through
   * delegation/redirection, sharing a same Process context.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * When the <code>processId</code> is null, simple models may just run without a formal <code>Process</code>, i.e. by assigning a simple arbitrary execution
   * ID for the <code>ProcessHandle</code>. More formal execution situations may choose to generate a new <code>Process</code> internally when
   * needed/appropriate. This choice can be made either in implementations of this service, or by specialised actors used in the flows.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * Remark that loading a complete <code>Process</code> context in memory can be a costly operation. So when detailed <code>Process</code> data is not
   * absolutely required, it is preferable to just pass the <code>processId</code> around.
   * </p>
