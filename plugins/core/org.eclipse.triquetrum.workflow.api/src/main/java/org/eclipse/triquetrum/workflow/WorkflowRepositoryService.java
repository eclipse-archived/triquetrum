/**
 * This interface offers operations to manage Models in a repository.
 * <p>
 * As Models can be large and complex structures, lightweight ModelHandles are used as intermediate entities for most actions that must be done on the
 * repository. <br/>
 * A ModelHandle allows to obtain its associated Model, and/or metadata like the identifying "code", version info etc. <br/>
 * For environments with high throughputs and/or large models, it may be beneficial to use "compacted" ModelHandles as much as possible. These have only the
 * necessary metadata but not the actual Model nor raw flow definition XML/MOML. Only when really needed should the flow definition be retrieved via
 * <code>loadModelHandleWithContent</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The repository may be able to maintain different versions for the Models, in which case it is possible to indicate the current active version/revision. The
 * active version is the one that will be used when actions (e.g. executing) are performed on a Model by name or identifying code.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface offers a basic "linear" view on Models in a repository. More advanced repository interfaces (e.g. including Projects, rules modules, images
 * and other asset types) will/must be defined separately.
 * </p>
