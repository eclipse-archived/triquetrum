/**
 * A simple solution to easily allow access to the default {@link TriqFactory} implementation instance that should be available in a Triquetrum runtime.
 * <p>
 * This avoids the complexity where everything that needs to access the factory instance should implement one of the OSGi service retrieval methods (Activators
 * with ServiceTrackers, DS, ...).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It also allows an easy access from places where the DS component model can not be applied (e.g. from inside Actors whose creation life cycle can not be under
 * the control of DS).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Remark that in advanced runtime implementations, multiple factories might be present. E.g. one that constructs JPA entities to support persistent Task
 * processing traces, another for simple in-memory representations etc. This simple tracker approach does not provide for such cases, i.e. it only manages a
 * single factory instance that was configured to be the default one. To access other factory instances, some specific coding will still be needed.
 * </p>
