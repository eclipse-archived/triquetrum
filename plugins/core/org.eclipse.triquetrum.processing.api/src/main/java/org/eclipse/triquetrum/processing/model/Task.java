/**
 * A Task specifies an item of work to be performed. It defines WHAT must be done, not how it must be achieved.
 * <p>
 * Simple work can be handled as one "unit of work" that can be executed by a <code>TaskProcessingService</code>. Complex tasks could be handled by a workflow
 * execution, where actors launch sub-tasks for each meaningful step to get the work done. In such cases the Task also has a process ID, identifying the
 * workflow process execution instance (workflow guys often call this an "enactment").
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The definition consists of following main elements :
 * <ul>
 * <li>type : the main differentiator on the kind of work to be performed</li>
 * <li>a set of parameters : these define the data needed to perform the given task</li>
 * <li>results : the internal structure is a set of result blocks containing result items. In specialized domains, like science, raw results may not be fit for
 * internal storage but could e.g. be stored in special/huge files. Then the triq result items may be used to represent references to such files/datasets,
 * and/or derived data obtained during the workflow execution.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
