 * A simple solution to easily allow access to the single {@link TaskProcessingBroker} implementation instance that should be available in a Triquetrum runtime.

 * This avoids the complexity where everything that needs to access the broker instance should implement one of the OSGi service retrieval methods (Activators
 * with ServiceTrackers, DS, ...).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It also allows an easy access from places where the DS component model can not be applied (e.g. from inside Actors whose creation life cycle can not be under
 * the control of DS).
